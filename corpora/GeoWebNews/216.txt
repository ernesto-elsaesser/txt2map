ATLANTA (AP) An aide to former Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been indicted in an ongoing bribery investigation at City Hall. The U.S. Attorney's Office told news outlets that a federal grand jury indicted the Rev. Mitzi Bickers on 11 counts Thursday morning. She faces charges including bribery, wire fraud, money laundering, and filing false tax returns. Bickers ran the Department of Human Services for three years. Her duties included running city programs to help the homeless and distributing federal and local funding to homeless shelters. Prosecutors say the bribes totaled more than $2 million. The investigation has been ongoing for two years. The city's former chief procurement officer, Adam Smith, along with city contractors Elvin "E.R." Mitchell Jr. and Charles P. Richards Jr. have pleaded guilty to bribery charges.
