MEXICO CITY (AP) Mexico's Senate has passed a resolution calling for the suspension of cooperation on illegal immigration and drug trafficking in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to the border. Presidential candidate Ricardo Anaya went further, saying Mexico should limit anti-terrorism cooperation until the National Guard was withdrawn. Others took Trump's move with a grain of salt. The newspaper El Heraldo said in a headline Thursday "U.S. deploys National Guard ... tin soldiers." Front-running presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Mexico should send a line of white-clad peace demonstrators to the border.
