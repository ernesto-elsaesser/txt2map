TITLE: Governor to defy Trump’s border order LINK: http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/oregon-governor-kate-brown-to-defy-donald-trumps-mexico-border-order/news-story/4786f050dc98b88b5c29880a1fbcf767?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+newscomaunthamericandm+%28News.com.au+%7C+World+%7C+North+America%29
Mr Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the National Guard would be sent to the Mexico border “immediately” to stop illegal immigrants. However, Gov. Brown said there had been no request by the Trump Administration to Oregon to send troops. “If [President Trump] asks me to deploy Oregon Guard troops to the Mexico border, I’ll say no,” she tweeted. “As Commander of Oregon’s Guard, I’m deeply troubled by Trump’s plan to militarise our border.”

Mr Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday night to allow the deployment, but the decisions have to be made in conjunction with the governors of the four border states. The Republican governors of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico — three states that border Mexico — backed the president’s move.

However, California Governor Jerry Brown said without key details — including the number of troops, the duration of their deployment and the cost — the Democratic governor was also unwilling to commit to the effort. The administration’s request “will be promptly reviewed to determine how best we can assist our federal partners,” California National Guard spokesman Lt. Colonel Tom Keegan said in a statement.

National Guard personnel would not be allowed to arrest people crossing the border — something barred by federal law — but could provide support to the Border Patrol. Under U.S. law, people who have an asylum claim must be given a hearing, and in many cases are released until their court date. Families with minor children cannot be held in detention for more than 20 days under certain circumstances. Government figures show that a large majority of those who are released do show up for their hearings.
