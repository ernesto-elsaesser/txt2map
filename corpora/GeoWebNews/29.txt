The Osun State Police Command on Thursday said it recovered 86 assorted firearms and 88 unexpended cartridges in the state. The state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Olafimihan Adeoye, disclosed this while addressing journalists in Osogbo, the state capital. He said the firearms recovery was done in line with the directive of the Inspector General of Police which directed Nigerians to submit the weapons to the police. He said though few of the firearms were submitted willingly to the police, most of them were recovered from the criminals.

He said the weapons recovered included Dane guns, pistols (locally fabricated and automatic), automatic rifles (AK47, LARS, pump-action) and other locally fabricated shotguns. Adeoye recalled that the IGP gave a deadline for Nigerians, private security and vigilantes to submit the firearms in their possession to the nearest police station and those who failed to comply would be tagged as criminals. He, however, said the Osun Police Command would still extend the amnesty to people with firearms to surrender them. He said firearms were in three categories, namely muscle loading, personal and prohibited.
