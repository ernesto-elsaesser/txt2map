TITLE: The winning Mega Millions numbers were picked at this N.J. gas station LINK: http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2018/03/this_nj_gas_station_sold_fourth_largest_jackpot_in.html
The winning Mega Millions numbers were selected at the Lukeoil gas station in Riverdale for the Friday, March 30, 2018, (3/30/18) drawing. The winning ticket, worth an estimated $521 million for a single winner, was sold in Morris County.(

The lucky person holding the $521 million lotto ticket has yet to come into the Morris County gas station where it was sold, but the store's owner is sure it's a regular. "Even though we're on the side of a highway, we've got a small-town feel," the Lukoil's owner, Ameer Karass, said of the Riverdale area in a phone interview Saturday. "We know all of our customers, so I'm thinking it might be one of our usuals." The winning Mega Millions ticket was sold Thursday, and all three cashiers were working. But they can't figure out who sold the lucky ticket, which holds the fourth largest jackpot in the history of the Mega Millions game. "We honestly have no idea," said Nash Riad, one of the cashiers. "Maybe the winner will tell us. I can't believe it, it's just so much money. "I guess I need to start buying tickets here." 

Nash Riad, John Rafaeil,and Nancy Levan are cashiers at Riverdale Luke Oil gas station, home of the $521 Million jackpot. Taylor Tiamoyo Harris for NJ Advance Media.

Though the cashiers won't get the $521 million, the owner says he will get a portion of the proceeds for selling the ticket, and all of his employees will get a bonus. He also said he'll decide a charity he'll give some of the proceeds to next week. The store will get $30,000 for selling Friday's winning ticket that matched all six numbers: white balls 11, 28, 31, 46 and 59, and the gold Mega Ball 1. It's the first time the Mega Millions jackpot has been hit since January when an unnamed man in Florida won $451 million. The mysterious winner will have a choice between the estimated annuity value of $521 million or the estimated lump-sum cash value of $317.2 million. John Reekie, who lives in New York and owns horses nearby in Riverdale, says he buys tickets at the Riverdale gas station all the time but bought his Mega Million ticket in New York on Thursday. "I can't be mad," he said. "It's a gamble. You know that when you play." There's a one in 259 million chance that someone picks the correct number on the five white balls and one yellow ball.
