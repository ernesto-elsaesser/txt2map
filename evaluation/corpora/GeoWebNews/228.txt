Zachary Brooks, 24, got high on tina and left Timothy to die unattended in the backyard of his home in Slidell, La., on March 5. A photo of the pool shows it full of filthy black water, covered with green scum, and filled with ‘all kinds of trash,’ according to police. Police Chief Randy Fandal said: ‘There is no question in my mind that the drug use, the deplorable conditions of the house, and the way Timothy was being cared for, contributed to his death.’ Timothy died on March 5 after being looked after by Brooks, who was the boy’s main carer after his mother was arrested on drugs charges.
