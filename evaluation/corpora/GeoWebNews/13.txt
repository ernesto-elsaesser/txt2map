Hanoi (VNA) – Vietnam always supports and wants Russia to play a greater role in the Asian-Pacific region, considering it an active element to peace and stability in the region and the world, said General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen Phu Trong. The Party chief made the remark at a reception for visiting Minister of Defence of Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoyu in Hanoi on January 23. “The Party, State, National Assembly, Government and people of Vietnam have greatly treasured the traditional friendship and efficient cooperation with Russia and have always attached importance to developing the comprehensive strategic partnership with the country, regarding it as one of top priorities in their foreign policy,” he stated. He spoke highly of the results of the talks between Defence Ministers Ngo Xuan Lich and Sergey Shoyu, adding that “Vietnam sees Russia as a prioritized partner in cooperation in military technology based on high trust and not aiming to act against a third country, contributing to safeguarding peace, stability and sustainable development in Asia-Pacific and the world.” Close and regular cooperation between the two defence ministries has helped ratchet up the comprehensive strategic partnership of the two countries, Party chief Trong said, expressing his belief that the outcomes gained during Minister Sergey Shoyu’s visit will contribute to reinforcing and deepening the partnership, especially in defence and military technology cooperation. The Russian Minister said Russia always places importance to reinforcing and developing the traditional friendship and comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam and will spare no effort to push the implementation of signed agreements, particularly on defence and military technology cooperation, to make practical changes in the bilateral ties. The Russian Ministry of Defence will work closely with the Vietnamese Defence Ministry to promote the bilateral defence ties to grow in a long-term, practical, efficient and reliable manner, he said.-VNA
