Royal Wedding fever is at fever pitch, with Harry and Meghan's nuptials just around the corner. And to celebrate, Iceland has released their own version of the royal cake. Iceland have announced they will be stocking a handmade elderflower and lemon cake, which will be available in store from the 14 May for one week only, and will cost 8.00. Which is a tiny slice of the proposed price, which has been priced at 50,000. There will only be a limited amount of cakes available in each store, so you'll need to be quick if you want to grab yours.
