The Complete Streets project we are celebrating today will enhance bicycle and pedestrian networks. It will also provide for the installation of street lighting and the construction of new bus shelters, making our community safer and more accessible. I thank Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao for recognizing the need and awarding this critical grant to revitalize Immokalee. I look forward to continue working with County Commissioner Bill McDaniel and other local leaders in seeing this project through.”
