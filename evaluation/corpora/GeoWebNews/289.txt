TITLE: Canadians to start getting emergency alerts on their cellphones LINK: https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadians-to-start-getting-emergency-alerts-on-their-cellphones-1.3873697
Starting today, Canadians won't have to be near a television or radio to receive emergency alerts. Life-threatening emergencies will now be broadcast on compatible mobile phones. As of today, the National Public Alerting System - commonly called Alert Ready - will include wireless networks, in addition to traditional broadcast channels. In the case of a life-threatening emergency, officials will send a localized alert that will compel compatible phones to emit an alarm and display a bilingual text warning. Situations that could prompt an alert include forest fires, terrorist threats or an Amber Alert for a missing child. Canada's broadcast regulator, the CRTC, has said that wireless carriers will conduct one test of the system during the week of May 6. The shrill, siren-like alarm tone is the same one that currently accompanies emergency broadcasts on radio and television. The Alert Ready website says individuals will not be billed for the messages.
