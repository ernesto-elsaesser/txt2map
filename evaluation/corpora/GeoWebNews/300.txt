TITLE: Lin-Manuel Miranda has shingles, quarantined from baby son LINK: http://www.islandpacket.com/entertainment/celebrities/article208116294.html
Lin-Manuel Miranda thought he had a migraine. It turns out the Broadway star really had shingles. Miranda tweeted on Thursday the diagnosis was caught early, but he's been quarantined from his 8-week-old son. He says his ophthalmologist has blurred his eyes and he's wearing a mask. He posted a "Phantom of the Opera" gif. Miranda's son, Francisco, was born in February. He also has a 3-year-old son, Sebastian. The 38-year-old wrote the book, music and lyrics and starred in the Broadway smash "Hamilton."

Shingles is a viral disease that causes a painful rash that is usually resolved within days or weeks.
