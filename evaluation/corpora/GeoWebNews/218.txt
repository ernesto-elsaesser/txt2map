Marine turtle session underway at Secondary School. (PHOTO: V. Clarke) OVER 70 students from two primary and two senior secondary schools in the south of the island participated in an environmental education programme under a project entitled: Supporting more effective marine turtle conservation within the Pointe Sable Environmental Protection Area. Students gained a wealth of first-hand knowledge about marine turtles that nest on Saint Lucian beaches and feed along the island’s coastal waters. The students also learned about threats to marine turtles globally and about local laws and initiatives oriented to the conservation of the marine species. The sessions were coordinated jointly by the Fisheries Department and the Saint Lucia National Trust (SLNT) using age-relevant and modern teaching materials that helped to capture the students’ interest. In some cases, the students came well-prepared with background information about marine turtles. Ms. Yvonne Edwin, Fisheries Assistant-Communications Officer commented: “We showed some excellent videos which brought the topic alive and sparked the students’ curiosity. Questions abounded and by the time we completed the session, the level of interest from both teachers and students was such that they now aim to start an Environmental Club at the school.” Mr. Craig Henry of the Saint Lucia National Trust added: “The young folks that I worked with were quite into the sessions from the start. Most of them had seen a marine turtle before but could not identify the species. They seemed quite fascinated as they learned more and they have the potential to become active marine turtle conservationists.” He added: “We are thankful to our partners – the OAS, WIDECAST, schools and teachers for making this initiative possible. Several additional schools are requesting this type of Ministry of Education approved training in order to diversify their students’ learning experience.”
