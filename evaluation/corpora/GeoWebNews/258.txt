TITLE: FrontCounter BC is open for business in Nelson LINK: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018FLNR0054-000574
Nelson residents will find it even easier to access government services with the official opening of a brand new FrontCounter BC office in their community, Michelle Mungall, MLA for Nelson-Creston, announced today on behalf of Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “The opening of a FrontCounter BC in Nelson is great news,” said Mungall. “It means local businesses will have the tools and support they need to grow and expand, and it means more services for our community.” FrontCounter BC provides services on behalf of 16 partner agencies and offers more than 140 natural resource-related permits and authorizations at each location. “By expanding FrontCounter BC services into Nelson, government is following through on its commitment to help strengthen economic development opportunities in rural communities,” said Donaldson. “This new office provides a one-stop location for a wide array of government services, including natural resource authorizations.” The new location, at 401 - 333 Victoria St., is the 30th FrontCounter BC office to open in the province. Instead of driving to Castlegar, people will be able to visit the Nelson office and get support with their natural resource enquiries. In-person help with applications and tools is also available, including authorizations for water use, Crown-land use and mining, and fish and wildlife permits, such as hunting and species licences. The new office allows people to access government online services such as BCeID, online application systems, mineral titles online, Small Business BC services and resources, and online mapping tools. Quick Facts: Since Jan. 1, 2007, FrontCounter BC has processed over 125,000 authorizations. The FrontCounter BC contact centre handles more than 47,000 inquiries annually.
