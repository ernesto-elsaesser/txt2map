TITLE: New 'Below Deck Mediterranean' crew features 2 Long Islanders LINK: https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/below-deck-long-islanders-1.17752375
Two Long Islanders are on board for the new season of Bravo’s reality TV series “Below Deck Mediterranean.” Kasey Cohen, who grew up in Oceanside, and Colin Macy-O’Toole, who captains a ferry to and from Fire Island, will appear in season 3 of the show that chronicles the work hard, play harder activities of a group of 20-somethings who work on a luxury boat. In the new season, which begins May 15, Cohen is a third stew and Macy-O’Toole is a deckhand aboard the superyacht Talisman Maiton. Though not experienced in the world of boating, Cohen competed in many pageants, was a straight-A student in high school and has a bachelor’s degree in psychology, according to the network. Macy-O’Toole, however, began his seafaring career as a deckhand and is described by the network as “a quintessential mama’s boy” who likes to make people laugh.

In addition, Dr. Francis Martinis, a urologist from Fort Salonga, and his wife, Jessica, appear as charter guests on the May 22 episode. Cohen and Macy-O’Toole are not the first Long Islanders to set sail on “Below Deck.” In 2016, David and Jodi Mahler of Bellmore appeared as charter-yacht guests on an episode.
