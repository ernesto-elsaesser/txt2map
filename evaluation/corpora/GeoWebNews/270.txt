TITLE: Yes on Cuyahoga County Issue 9, renewal of 3.9-mill health and human services levy:... LINK: http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2018/04/_endorsement_editorial.html
MetroHealth Medical Center, the county hospital system, is one of the beneficiaries of the Health and Human Services levy. (

By Editorial Board Cuyahoga County's health and human services levies help young children attend high-quality preschool, provide treatment for the mentally ill and the drug-addicted and ensure that last-resort medical care is available to all in the county at MetroHealth Medical Center, among many other services.

This year, Issue 9 , the smaller of the two levies, is on the May 8 ballot. It's an important 3.9-mill two-year renewal that will bring in $104 million annually. The levy, which will not raise taxes, costs the owner of a $100,000 home about $135 a year. This levy does so much that losing it would be "catastrophic," Cuyahoga County Executive Armond Budish told the editorial board Tuesday. Two recent controversies do not reflect overall on the tremendous work the county does in human services. The first is the death of Aniya Day-Garrett , a four-year-old girl who was not removed from her home by county workers, who said they lacked evidence of abuse, a failure that is still under investigation. Aniya's mother and her mother's boyfriend have been charged with aggravated murder in the girl's death. Then there's the ongoing corruption investigation that has named several Cuyahoga County employees, none in the county's social services departments. Issue 9 is vital for our community and deserves county voters' support. Early voting in the May 8 primary begins April 10.
