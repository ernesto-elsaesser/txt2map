TITLE: Tesco is selling its My department store in Bratislava LINK: https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20796200/tesco-is-selling-its-my-department-store-in-bratislava.html
The British retail chain Tesco is continuing the sale of its department stores, formerly Priors, in Slovakia. Following the sale of its stores in Žilina, Nitra, Prešov and Košice the retail chain is now selling its last piece of real estate in Slovakia, the department store My (We in English) on Kamenné Square in Bratislava. Tesco Stores SR has confirmed negotiations with potential buyers, the Trend weekly reported. One possible buyer is allegedly the British developer Lordship. They own the adjacent Hotel Kyjev, which they plan to rebuild along with other real estate in its vicinity. In the past, Lordship and Tesco held talks about the sale of the department store, but negotiations failed. The retail chain admits that the department store, opened in 1968, needs significant investment for its modernisation. Tesco acquired the building from the American company K-Mart in 1996. Both the department store and the hotel were designed by the prominent Slovak architect Ivan Matušík. 5. Apr 2018 at 13:51 | Compiled by Spectator staff Get daily Slovak news directly to your inbox.
