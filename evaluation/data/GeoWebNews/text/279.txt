A South Side man has been charged with murder in the stabbing death of a software CEO in River North last month, according to Chicago police. Gino D. Bassett, Sr., 56, of the 6100 block of South Ingleside Avenue, is charged with first degree murder and two misdemeanor counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, police said.

Bassett is accused of stabbing Miguel Beedle, 55, of Park Ridge on March 23 around 2:30 a.m. in an alley in the 400 block of North State Street on the Near North Side. Police say Bassett approached Beedle in the alley and stabbed him in the back.

Beedle stumbled out of the alley and collapsed at the corner of State and Hubbard streets, police said. He was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. After the stabbing, Bassett ran away into the nearby Red Line subway platform at Grand and State where he waved the knife at two women in the stairwell, police allege. The women, 21 and 26, told police Bassett threatened to stab them. Bassett was arrested on Wednesday around 10:20 a.m. after he was “positively identified” as the person who killed Beedle, police said in a press release. Beedle was the founder and CEO of Enterprise Scrum, a software company, and was the father of six children, aged from 19 to 1.
