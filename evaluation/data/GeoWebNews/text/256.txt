SEVERN, Md. (ABC7) â€” A 55-year-old Severn, Md. man was arrested after police say child pornography was found inside an auctioned storage locker that he had previously rented. Maryland State Police say inside the locker were electronic devices -- including hard drives, DVDs and VHS tapes. Police say one of the videos showed the accused, Glenn Ranger, sexually assaulting a girl who has since been identified as a victim since she was 16 years old. Authorities believe the abuse went on for six to eight years. Officials say another video showed a boy around six to eight years of age was also identified as a victim of sexual assault. Authorities are working to identify more victims. Investigators believe Ranger filmed the assaults using a camera he hid inside a bedroom at an Anne Arundel home where he no longer lives. In a press release, Maryland State Police say Ranger was charged with the following: "He is charged with three counts each of second degree rape, second degree sex offense, third degree sex offense, and fourth degree sex offense. He is also charged with one count each of sexual abuse of a minor, sexual abuse of a minor with a continuing course of conduct, production of child pornography and possession of child pornography. Additional charges are pending."
