TITLE: Annual Review of Global Biopesticide and Biocontrol Industry 2017 LINK: http://news.agropages.com/News/NewsDetail---25904.htm
Philip Kessler, International Market Development Director of Andermatt Biocontrol AG : Both China and Brazil will have a significant increased demand for biological solutions, as both countries are giants in the global agricultural market. In China, the government realized that, to produce sufficient and safe food for its population in a sustainable way, their agriculture needs to be greener, thus more biological. In Brazil, biopesticides as well as biostimulants are getting more important due to higher efficacy of these solutions, particularly under challenging soil conditions. Resistance of pest populations towards chemical pesticides triggers the use of biopesticides. Furthermore, the use of microorganisms helps to improve biological soil activity in soils, where detrimental overuse of chemical pesticides and fertilizers turned agricultural soil into non-usable agricultural deserts.

Philip Kessler: The range of baculovirus products to be used as insecticides has significantly increased over the last years, but its volumes still have a minor share compared to bacterial or fungal insecticides. Baculoviruses are extremely host-specific, which turns them safe for the environment as well for user and consumer, but which limits its market potential. However, baculoviruses are not only used in organic production, but can be easily integrated into existing IPM programs and represents an ideal tool for resistance management and to be used in residue-free food production. We therefore expect a further demand for pest management based on baculovirus products.
