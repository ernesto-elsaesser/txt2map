Arlington woman was 'the juice' for her family. Kimberly Renee Underwood’s father nicknamed her "the juice" because she was the spark of the family. At 4, she ran down the aisle of an Ohio church saying: "I love Jesus! I love Jesus! Baptize me!" Church leaders didn’t believe in baptizing a child so young, but she was adamant, so they relented, relatives said last week. She was the one to encourage the family to have a weekend barbecue, to get her parents to take a trip to Cancun, to find the best deals on a cute handbag. "She was kind of like the one who kept things moving," said her mother, Mamie Underwood. Ms. Underwood, 34, of Arlington, died Tuesday of an unknown cause. The Tarrant County medical examiner’s office is investigating the cause of death. Ms. Underwood was an answer to her parents’ prayers for a child, her mother said. She was the second of three. "She was a prayer warrior," her mother said. "She was a fervent believer in God and his power and in praying and the power of prayer. She believed when there was a problem to pray." Ms. Underwood, born Dec. 20, 1974, spent the first 10 years of her life in Wintersville, Ohio, before the family moved to Arlington. Her father is an engineer, and her mother is an employee of the federal General Services Administration. Ms. Underwood was an honor student and graduated from O.D. Wyatt High School in Fort Worth in 1993. She attended law school at Texas Southern University in Houston. Her younger sister, Kalena Horhn of Grand Prairie, said she remembers riding on a Big Wheel with her big sister in front. "She was full of wisdom, of hopes and of dreams," she said. Ms. Underwood’s mother said she often went out of her way to help others. When a friend lost her job, Ms. Underwood invited her to stay with her, rent free. "Her heart was not as big as Texas," her mother said. "It was bigger than Texas." Other survivors include a 15-month old son, Kingston James, and her father, Gary Underwood. Her funeral was Saturday.
