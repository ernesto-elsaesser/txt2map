Grand Prairie police investigate teen's shooting death after weekend party 10:22 AM CT. Grand Prairie police are investigating the death of a 16-year-old who was killed and another who was injured early Sunday after an altercation at an Arlington party. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner identified the Arlington teen as Mitchell Taleferio, but police said Taleferio was the teenâ€™s first name. According to police, Taleferio was at a party with friends and may have gotten into an altercation with another group of teens. After he left the party with his friends, their red 1991 Honda broke down and they stopped at an Exxon gas station on Mayfield Road and State Highway 360 to fix it. A red Dodge Durango with a group of teens who may have been at the party also drove to the gas station and started fighting with Taleferio and his friends. Taleferio and his friends left the gas station and stopped about a half-mile away at a light at Forum Drive and Mayfield Road in Grand Prairie when the Durango pulled up next to them. Shots fired from the Durango struck Taleferio in the back of the head, police said. The Honda's driver, another 16-year-old, also was struck and suffered non-life threatening injuries. The injured teen drove to USMD Medical Center in Arlington, and Taleferio was later airlifted to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth where he was pronounced dead, authorities said.
