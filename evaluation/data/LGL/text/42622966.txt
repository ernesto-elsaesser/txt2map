Pott Co. would get biggest boost from US-24 project. Pottawatomie County likely will be the biggest economic benefactor of a US-24 corridor expansion project, according to preliminary results of a study funded by area government and KDOT. That was the message consultants told visitors at a town hall meeting at the Green Valley Community Center Wednesday evening. The study is being performed in part to assess the effect that recent and future economic expansion will have on the highway and jobs in the Manhattan area through 2030. It is also looking at what those effects will be and where they will occur. Similar studies are being performed in other counties through which US-24 runs, such as Leavenworth and Shawnee. The National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility and the jobs it likely will create in the Manhattan area also was a major factor in the local study. Consultants said they based it in part on communities with similar federal research facilities, such as Fermilab in Kane County, Ill., and NERI in Jefferson County, Colo. A similar meeting was held Wednesday in St. George. A third meeting takes place at 5 this evening at the Wamego Seniors Center.
