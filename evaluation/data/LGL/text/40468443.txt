Gang threat just a hoax. Willis said police had received reports from several states about the text message and many people locally had received it. He added they have been backwards-tracing the trail of the message. The message was being sent out locally, with people receiving it and then forwarding it to others. Willis said the local connection splits past a certain number of text messages, with some coming from the Knoxville area and others coming from around Chattanooga. McMinn County Sheriff Steve Frisbie, who received several calls about the text message and e-mail, said some members of his staff actually received the message on their phone. They looked it up on the Internet and saw several sites that stated it was a hoax.
