Seat belt use declines in Johnson County . Just three years ago, 85 percent of Johnson County residents buckled up in what was then an all-time high for the state, state officials said Friday. Mysteriously, the Johnson County rate last year was only 80 percent. Meanwhile, Leavenworth County has surged forward and last year led the state with an 86 percent rate. Douglas and Wyandotte counties also have improved in recent years, and last year more than 80 percent of people in those counties used seat belts, said Greg Scott with the Kansas Department of Transportation.
