Family of Jordan motorcyclist finds him injured in ditch. A wife’s quick action may have saved her husband’s life after his motorcycle went off the road in Sand Creek Township early Wednesday morning. When Lori Whipps received a call that her husband Roger hadn’t shown up for work, she and family members immediately went looking from him. They discovered him in a ditch on Marystown Road, about one-third of a mile north of Highway 282 around 5 a.m. Scott County Deputy Sgt. Bob Mulvehill said it appeared Roger Whipps, who wasn’t wearing a helmet, lost control while going around a curve and he was ejected from his motorcycle. The Jordan resident was flown to North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale, where he remains in critical condition. It is unclear what caused the man to leave the roadway. Mulvehill said the Whipps was still unresponsive as of Thursday morning.
