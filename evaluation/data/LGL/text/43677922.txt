DNR tickets out-of-state boaters avoiding Ind. tax. HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) Â— The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is cracking down on out-of-state boaters who do not pay Indiana excise taxes. More than 300 people with boats moored in Hammond and East Chicago have been fined for failing to pay the tax. As many as 89 people could face fines of $500 and have their driver's licenses suspended for not acting on the tickets. Out-of-state residents can register their boats in their home state, but must pay Indiana excise taxes if they boat in Indiana. The recent crackdown was prompted in part by complaints by angry Indiana residents who pay the state's excise tax when they register their boats. ``These people felt they were being cheated,'' said DNR Lt. Jerry Shepherd. At the large Hammond Marina, about 85 percent of boaters live outside of Indiana. Port Authority Director Milan Kruszynski said ticketed boaters weren't happy, especially since they have to travel to Lowell Town Court if they want to contest the ticket. Of the more than 300 boaters cited in Hammond and East Chicago, between 150 and 200 refused to comply, contested or did not respond to the notice, said DNR Public Information Officer Shawn Brown. The Indiana General Assembly passed a law in 2006 to allow greater enforcement of the state's excise tax. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources launched a public education campaign to convince out-of-state boaters that Indiana is serious about collecting the tax.
