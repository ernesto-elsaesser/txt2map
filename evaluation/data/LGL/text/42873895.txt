Funeral begins for 4 slain Oakland, police. Thousands of officers and firefighters from around the nation and overseas along with mourners turned out for Friday's funeral for the four Oakland Police Department veterans. The four officers were shot in the line of duty Saturday, the biggest single day, gun-related loss of life for law enforcement since four federal agents died 15 years ago during a raid on the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas. (The Associated Press) Police said Hege and Dunakin were gunned down March 21 when the two motorcycle officers pulled over a 26-year-old parolee during a traffic stop. Romans, Sakai and the parolee died later in a shootout when the city's SWAT team stormed an apartment where the man was hiding.
