The victim, also 14, suffered "two small, shallow puncture wounds" that were not life-threatening, said Lt. Paul Henderson, a police spokesman. She was taken to Cook Children’s Medical Center. The argument between the girls escalated at the school, police said. One girl grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed the other girl repeatedly in the chest. The suspect was taken to a juvenile detention facility. — Alex Branch
