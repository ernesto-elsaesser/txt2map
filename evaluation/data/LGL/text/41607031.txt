(Donna Baxter / for the News-Leader) Logan Elementary was formed in 1952 when eight eastern Greene County rural districts consolidated. High school students had a choice -- Rogersville or Springfield. Two years later, seven rural Christian and Webster County districts consolidated into Rogersville. In 1965, Rogersville voted to annex to Logan. A new high school was built in southeast Greene County. All grade 7 and 8 students -- who up to that time had attended the two elementary buildings -- were moved into the old high school in Rogersville. The elementaries remained separate until 1983 when the district was reorganized. K-5 students attended Logan and grade 6-8 students went to Rogersville. After several subsequent reorganizations, Logan-Rogersville has five campuses (including the Logan building) with a population of nearly 2,300.
