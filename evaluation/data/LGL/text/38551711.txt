Readington Superintendent decides not to take salary increase. – Jorden Schiff, superintendent for the grade K-8 district, has agreed to have his salary frozen during the last year of his contract, saying he believes it is the right decision as many others face salary freezes during this poor economy. The township Board of Education voted to approve a new five-year contract for Schiff at its Feb. 24 meeting, which provides a 3.75 percent increase each year. But Schiff surprised everyone by declining to accept any salary increase this year, the last year of his contract, which ends June 2010. “He had already told us he would accept half the contractual increase but we were taken completely by surprise when he announced he would give up any increase at all,” said Deb Labbadia, the board president. “I felt like it is the right thing to do,” said Schiff on March 6. “These are difficult economic times. A lot of people are losing jobs; others are dealing with salary freezes and furloughs.”
