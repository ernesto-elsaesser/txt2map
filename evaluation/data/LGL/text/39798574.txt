Water main repaired in north DeKalb. Repairs have been completed on a water main break in north DeKalb County, county spokeswoman Kristie Swink said. The 16-inch main broke about 4:30 p.m. Monday. It is 23 feet below grade along the southbound I-85 access road between Clairmont and North Druid Hills roads. With workers digging to repair the pipe, one lane of the two-lane road was closed. It will remain closed until the hole in the road is repaired, Swink said. The road could take a couple days to fix, she said.
