Former Bloomfield Town Councilman Richard Days Dead At 79. BLOOMFIELD â€” - "All." That's the word gravelly-voiced Richard "Dik" Days would repeat and emphasize at the end of the Pledge of Allegiance that opened Bloomfield Town Council meetings during his 12 years as a member. Days, whose tenure on the council ended in 2007, died Wednesday after a long battle with lung cancer. He was 79. "He reminded us that we shouldn't forget any of our people and that all folks deserve equal treatment," Councilman Larry Pleasant said Thursday. "We still do that."
