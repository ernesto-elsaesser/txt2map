Cookville Volunteer Fire Department hosts 19th annual fundraiser Saturday. The Cookville Volunteer Fire Department will host its 19th annual fundraiser Saturday, March 28, from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the fire station in Cookville, located on County Road 4045, behind the Cookville store. According to Cookville Fire Chief Wesley McCollum, patrons attending can expect a family-friendly environment with a hip hop for the kids and dominoes for the adults, as well as a scrumptious spread including brisket, crawfish, baked beans, potato salad and desserts prepared by volunteers, families and community members. A pie and cake auction will also be held at 6 p.m., McCollum said, and door prizes will be given away. "We have tons of door prizes people have donated, and we will probably be giving away around four an hour," McCollum said. The event will be free to the public but donations will be accepted and appreciated, he added. "We know not everyone can afford to donate right now, but we want to welcome everyone to come out and visit with us and enjoy some good food and fun," McCollum said.
