Montana airplane crash victims had Laurel ties. Four of the 14 passengers who died in an airline crash in Montana Sunday had ties to Laurel County. Brent Ching, his wife Kristen and his children, Hailey, 6, and Caleb, 4, all of whom died in the crash, were related to the late Dr. Caleb Chu, who worked as a physician at Oneida Mountain Hospital for more than 30 years. Brent Ching was Chu’s grandson. Chu’s widow and Ching’s stepgrandmother, Priscilla, has lived in London for more than 30 years. Priscilla Chu said the family was flying from Oroville, Calif., to Montana for a ski trip. Chu said the Chings were avid skiers. “Even the little ones skied,” she said. Chu said she heard about what happened while watching the news on TV. “When they mentioned Oroville, it clicked,” she said. Brent Ching, a dentist, was the son of Phyllis Chu, Caleb Chu’s daughter. While Phyllis Chu was raised in Clay County, Ching grew up in California. His uncle Perry Chu, who attended Laurel County High School, also lives out west. Priscilla Chu said she spoke to Perry, an anesthesiologist, Sunday. “He was in bad shape and was in shock,” she said. As to how she felt, Priscilla Chu just answered, “How would you feel?” Chu visited the Ching family in August and said the kids were a joy. “They were so young, they loved everybody,” she said. Seven of the 14 killed in the crash were believed to be children who ranged in age from 1 to 9. Around 11:30 a.m. Sunday, the plane was headed to Bozeman, Mont., but rerouted suddenly to Butte. The PC-12, which was built in 2001, nose-dived into Holy Cross Cemetery, just 500 feet short of the runway at Butte’s Bert Mooney Airport. Reports Tuesday showed ice might have been a factor in the crash. There were no survivors. Staff writer Tara Kaprowy can be reached by e-mail at tkaprowy@sentinel-echo.com.
