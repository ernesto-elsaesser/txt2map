Protesters visit homes of AIG executives. FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- A busload of activists -- outnumbered 2-to-1 by reporters and photographers -- are paying visits to the homes of American International Group Inc. executives in Connecticut to protest tens of millions in bonuses awarded by the company. About 40 protesters parked at a cul-de-sac this afternoon and walked to the Fairfield home of Douglas Polling. They were met on the curb by two security guards, and one protester read a letter detailing the financial struggles that many Connecticut residents have faced. The group then left the note in Polling's mailbox. Polling already agreed to forfeit his bonus, but the protesters want AIG executives to do more to help working families. AIG has received more than $182 billion in federal aid.
