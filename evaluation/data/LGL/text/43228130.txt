Two local events to aid leukemia victim. Terry Chase is suffering from a rare form of leukemia and is looking to the community for help. The 60-year-old Alton man was diagnosed with leukemia in August and discovered that his form of the disease does not respond to typical cancer drugs. Instead, he requires a stem cell transplant - a procedure similar to a bone marrow transplant, except that only stem cells from the marrow are used. "What initially seemed like a simple part of the whole thing, to find a donor, get a transplant, turned into the biggest hurdle of all of it," Chase said. Chase had to stop working due to chemotherapy and weekly blood transfusions. He is married with two stepchildren. Mike Guglielmo, New England ambassador for the bone marrow donor center DKMS Americas, is organizing a bone marrow drive today at the Meredith Community Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. A second group is conducting a drive tomorrow at Pizzeria Uno in Concord, at 15 Fort Eddy Road, from noon to 6 p.m. The Uno's drive is also a fundraiser, and 20 percent of proceeds from anyone who eats at the restaurant during that time will be given to the Chase family. Getting on the national bone marrow registry requires only a cheek swab.
