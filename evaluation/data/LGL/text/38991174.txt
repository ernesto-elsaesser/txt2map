Area funeral director charged in robberies. An Alton funeral director has been charged with robbing two Indiana banks of more than $10,000. Vanderburgh, Ind., County prosecutors last week charged George R, Chesnut with robbing Evansville Federal Credit Union on Dec. 5. The 46-year-old Chesnut was already in custody for allegedly robbing the First Bank of Princeton on March 6. Employees at First Bank told police that a man approached the counter at 4:45 p.m. wearing a baseball cap, a gray hooded jacket, blue jeans and white shoes and lifted his jacket to show the butt of a handgun tucked into his waistband, according to a search warrant. The warrant was filed Tuesday in Madison County for Chesnut's home in the 2400 block of Gillis Street in Alton. The man passed an index card to the teller which read "This a robbery. I have a gun. Do not call Police. Give me your hundreds, fifties and twenties. "An off-duty police officer stopped Chesnut's Ford Mustang, bearing Illinois license plates, a short while later. The officer traced the plates to the Gillis Street address. He found $4,470 in a bag inside the engine compartment, according to an affidavit filed with the search warrant. Chesnut matched the description of a suspect in the Dec. 5 bank robbery in which a man wearing a dark hooded jacket entered the bank and showed the teller the butt of his gun and demanded cash. Three tellers were working at the time, and the man approached her window speaking on a cell phone, according to a Vanderburgh County Sheriff's report. A teller gave him $5,800, according to the affidavit. The teller later picked Chesnut out of a police lineup, according to the report. On March 7, FBI agents searched Chesnut's home. They seized bank statements, collection notices, credit reports and bank notices that indicated that his Godfrey funeral business was struggling, according to the return.
