Budget would reduce funding for public schools. A House-Senate conference committee agreed Thursday on a state budget that reduces funding for public school districts but generally appears to leave higher education alone. That recommendation will be put to vote early next week, said Rep. Tom Hawk, a Manhattan Democrat, who believes the proposal is likely to be approved. Hawk said although the cuts were not favorable to K-12 education, he is "optimistic about the bipartisan consensus to use the stimulus dollars as much as possible."
