Knights blanked in Erie. London head coach Dale Hunter said the series wouldn’t be any different in Erie if the Knights stuck to “just playing hockey." But the Otters clearly aren’t playing the same hockey they did in the first two games of this OHL Western Conference quarterfinal series. Erie captain Zack Torquato struck on a tip-in on the power play that resulted from the penalty against Aarssen. Then, Sarnia native Brandon Biggers beat London goalie Trevor Cann through the wickets with a backhand on a shorthanded breakaway late in the first period to give the Otters a 2-0 lead. “On Saturdays, we don’t have to compete with anybody around here,” Erie GM Sherry Bassin said. “During the week, there are a lot of high school events going on. That’s why we wanted Saturdays. If we could’ve got our ice, we wouldn’t have played two-two (two in London, then two in Erie). We would’ve played the first in London on the Friday, then come home to play on the Saturday.” “That was a team that set a lot of records and it was a really great group to be around,” the 20-year-old from Brampton said. “But this is a great feeling, too. When we missed the playoffs all those years in Erie, you’re just thinking about when you’re going to get that chance and for us, this is it.”
