1 dead, 1 hurt in motorcycle crash. A motorcycle wreck on Rivers Avenue killed a pass-enger and sent the driver to the hospital Sunday afternoon, the North Charleston Police Department reported. The victims' names were not released Sunday. The driver's injuries did not appear to be life-threatening, Public Information Officer Spencer Pryor said. Initial reports indicate the motorcycle might have experienced some kind of malfunction, and as a result the passenger was thrown off and hit by a truck near Rivers and Stokes avenues shortly before 2 p.m., Pryor said.
