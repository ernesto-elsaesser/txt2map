Ex-officer testifies he did not rob drug dealers. But his effort to rebut the federal charges he is facing was undermined by his inability to identify a cell phone number he called or was called from 16 times before, during and after he allegedly robbed South Philadelphia drug kingpin Ricardo McKendrick Jr. on Dec. 14, 2007. Snell was fired shortly after his arrest in the incident. A federal trial that focused only on the Pottstown home invasion ended with a hung jury in October. Authorities expanded the charges against Snell after McKendrick and other reputed drug dealers agreed to cooperate against him.
