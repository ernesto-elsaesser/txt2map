Clinton Township residents of Waters Edge want in-ground pools. Maira said she had spoken with planning consultant Frank Banish and had been advised that pools had not been included as an accessory use when the area was zoned about 10 years ago because the plan at the time had called for high-density condominiums, not the single family homes that were eventually built. Cimei said the ordinance amending the regulations would be considered by the council next month, but would have to be referred to the Planning Board before it can be fully adopted. The timeline may take final adoption well into May, further delaying potential pool construction. Depending on when the work can be done, the five hopeful residents may have to wait well into the summer months before realizing the cooling effect of their swimming pools.
