Suburban sprawl encroaches on rural Ohio townships. MAINEVILLE, Ohio (AP) Â— Some rural townships in Ohio are imposing impact fees and other regulations on new residential development to keep suburban sprawl from encroaching on farmland. Officials in Warren County's Hamilton Township outside Cincinnati say the population spurt there is putting pressure on safety services and roadways. To cope with growth costs, the township imposed an impact fee on new development that led to a bitter and unresolved court challenge from home builders. Government officials also have changed a zoning code to limit the density of homes in rural areas. From 2002 to 2007, the number of farms in Warren County fell 14 percent from 1,036 to 896, one of the sharpest declines in the state.
