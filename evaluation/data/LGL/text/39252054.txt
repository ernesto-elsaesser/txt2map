Sewer line repaired after spill into Flat Creek tributary. A wastewater overflow within the Gainesville sewer system caused about 5,400 gallons to flow into a tributary of Flat Creek this afternoon. According to the Gainesville Public Utilities department, the spill was noticed at about 1:45 p.m. by an attendant at the Orchard Brook apartments in the 2900 block of McEver Road. Utility workers found debris blocking a sewer line and repaired the problem in about an hour. After cleaning up the area, they posted warning signs and contacted Hall County Environmental Health and the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. The spill is not considered major, but the EPD has a zero-tolerance policy for wastewater overflows that affect Lake Lanier's watershed.
