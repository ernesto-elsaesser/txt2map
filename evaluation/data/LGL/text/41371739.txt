Jury acquits man of sexual misconduct . Criminal charges have been dismissed against a Rochester man accused of sexually abusing a young girl in 2005. An Olmsted County jury acquitted Hugo Ernesto Lopez, 34, on Friday, following a four-day trial before Judge Jodi Williamson. Lopez was acquitted on two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, all felonies. He was represented by Rochester attorney Michael York. He was alleged to have sexually touched a young girl in spring 2005. He originally was charged with the two second-degree counts and a gross misdemeanor count of fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The complaint was amended a day before the trial started.
