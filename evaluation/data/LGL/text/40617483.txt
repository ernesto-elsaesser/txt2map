Medvedev Approves Treaties to Protect Abkhaz, S.Ossetian Borders. Russia’s President, Dmitry Medvedev, gave his go-ahead to signing of two separate treaties with Georgia’s breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia on March 20, the Kremlin said. Treaties on “joint measures for protection of the state borders,” which has yet to be signed, are separate from the ones on military cooperation that Moscow plans to sign with the both of the regions. Agreements on military cooperation will envisage a long-term stationing of the Russian military bases in the breakaway regions.
