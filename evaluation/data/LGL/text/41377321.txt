DeKalb not likely to approve mixed-use development. A developer’s call for a dense cluster of residences, retail and other uses north of Decatur is unlikely to get approved Tuesday by the DeKalb County Commission. Julian LeCraw & Co. has asked that land it controls near the intersection of North Druid Hills and Clairmont roads be designated as a “town center” under DeKalb’s long-term comprehensive plan. The land in unincorporated DeKalb contains the aging Williamsburg Apartment complex. It currently is designated for “suburban” use. The proposed use would allow greater density and more intense uses, such as shops, restaurants and condos, assuming the land also was re-zoned. Neighborhood groups in the area, including StandUp DeKalb, which helped to halt a mixed-use project proposed by Sembler Co. also on North Druid Hills Road, have voiced concern about increasing the density in that area. The issue appears on the county commission’s evening agenda Tuesday. But both commissioners who represent the area — Kathie Gannon and Jeff Rader — said in interviews that the application is premature. They said they want to see more planning in and around the project site. The meeting begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Manuel Maloof auditorium, 1300 Commerce Dr., in downtown Decatur.
