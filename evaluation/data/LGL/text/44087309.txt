Charges filed in shots at FBI agent in Cincinnati. CINCINNATI (AP) Â— Police and the FBI say two men from the Cincinnati area have been arrested in a drive-by shooting during which more than a dozen gunshots were fired at an on-duty FBI agent. Twenty-five-year-old Robert Coker was arrested Friday night, and 46-year-old Kenny Davis was arrested Monday. Both were charged with felonious assault and held in the Hamilton County jail. The agent wasn't hit by gunshot, but was cut by flying debris. The FBI has not released the agent's name. Authorities said Monday that the vehicle used in the shooting was searched, and that more suspects were being sought. A message seeking comment was left at the office of Coker's attorney, Peter Rosenwald. It was unclear whether Davis had an attorney.
