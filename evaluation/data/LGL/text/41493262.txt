Four-car collision critically injures woman, 82. A four-car crash in the northwestern Las Vegas Valley on Monday afternoon left an 82-year-old Las Vegas woman in critical condition, Metro Police said. She was the only person seriously injured in the collisions, police said. A 1996 Oldsmobile 88 driven by Howard Brown, 45, of Las Vegas was going westbound on Vegas Drive in the right of two travel lanes and had a green light, police said. A 1992 Toyota Corolla driven by Mary Lioce was traveling east in the left turn lane to go north on Decatur Boulevard. The Toyota failed to yield the right of way to the Oldsmobile before making the left turn, investigators said. The Oldsmobile was unable to stop before striking the Toyota. The Oldsmobile then was sent north into the southbound lanes of Decatur, where it struck a 2003 Honda Accord, driven by Marisa Huerta, 23 of Las Vegas and passenger Mauro Arellano-Tellez, 23, of San Diego. The Honda was stopped in the left of three southbound lanes and a 2007 Toyota Corolla driven by Gloria Major, 75, of Las Vegas with passenger Barbara Marlowe, 56, of Las Vegas, stopped in the center lane. Lioce, driving the Toyota turning left onto Decatur, was taken to University Medical Center's trauma unit in critical condition, police said. Brown, driver of the Oldsmobile, received minor injuries, police said. None of the others involved in the collisions were injured. The collision is under investigation by the Metro Police Accident Investigation Detail.
