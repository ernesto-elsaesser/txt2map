West Virginia man charged in widow's murder. Charles S. Williams, 39, of Wood County, W. Va., is currently being held in the North Central Regional Jail in Greenwood, W. Va., on a parole violation and will be returned to Meigs County, Prosecutor Colleen Williams said in a news release. Williams, along with James Lee Garnes, 39, of Pomeroy in Meigs County, also has been charged with receiving stolen property and tampering with evidence. Garnes appeared in Meigs County Court Friday and is being held on $50,000 bond. Williams is accused of killing Doris Jackson, whose strangled body was found inside her home Feb. 26. Local police recovered her stolen 1989 Mercury Marquis in Athens two days later. Jackson, who lived alone, hoarded packages, clothing, boxes and other items, county Sheriff Robert Beegle said, and her body was found beneath a three-foot pile of belongings. The prosecutor said she may seek additional charges against Williams when she presents the case to grand jury.
