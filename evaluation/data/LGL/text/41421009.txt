Arts center features works by master carver. WOODBURY — The Arts Center of Cannon County announces the opening of “An Old Man Has Visions” featuring the wood carvings of James Bunch. This exhibit will be featured in the Marly Berger Gallery through May 9. Working from memory, with only a pocketknife and the occasional handsaw, James Bunch has produced a body of work estimated at 300 pieces which range in subject matter from the familiar tools and mechanics which have been central to his life to elaborate pieces notable for their detail and kinetic features. “His human figures are perhaps most striking, consistently stylized as stiff but expressive individuals sharing hallmarks of character and community,” said Robert Cogswell, director of folklife for the Tennessee Arts Commission. Careful inspection of his work reveals not only fine carving but a commitment to carefully executing every part of his creations. Using the skills of a traditional wood carver, Bunch invents shockingly realistic creations that have to be seen to be believed. Admission to “An Old Man Has Visions” is free. The gallery is open from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday-Saturday. The Arts Center is located on 1424 John Bragg Highway. More information is available by calling (615) 563-2787 or (800) 235-9073.
