Juvenile arrested in Oxford bar had mother's blessing. Follow Hall of Famer Hal McCoy as he covers the Reds in spring training. Police arrested a 16-year-old female while conducting bar checks over the weekend, reporting the juvenile had obtained drinks at Brick Street Bar using a wristband her mother had given to her. Officers said they observed the girl exit the bar carrying on open bottle of beer, then stopped her for an open container violation. The suspect, of Pickerington, Ohio, allegedly told police she was in Oxford visiting along with her mother, who had already left the bar. Police said the juvenile initially told them she was 20, but said she had received a wristband marking her as over 21 from her mother. The girl reportedly became belligerent toward officers and was taken to the Oxford Police Department, where dispatchers alerted officers she was actually 16. The girl's mother did not appear concerned that her juvenile daughter was drinking in a bar at 1:40 in the morning, police said, asking officers to not cite her daughter. The juvenile was issued a citation for offenses involving underage persons and was released.
