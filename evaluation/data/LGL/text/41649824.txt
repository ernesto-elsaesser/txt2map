Developer wants to remake downtown Cleveland as outlet mall. Craig Kaser of Terremark Partners recently presented downtown property owners with a proposal to occupy empty retail space with the discount versions of upscale chains such as J. Crew and Banana Republic. Earlier, Kaser helped to transform East Fourth Street into an entertainment and restaurant district. Market analyst Richard Tunstall worked with Kaser on the outlet plan and says the stores would draw bargain shoppers who don't like the long trips to outlet malls in Geauga and Medina counties. But Joe Marinucci of the Downtown Cleveland Alliance says shoppers might need to be offered a break on downtown parking.
