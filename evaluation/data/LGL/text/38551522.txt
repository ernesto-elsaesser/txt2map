Jordan elementary gets Target reward. Jordan Elementary School Principal Stacy DeCorsey shows her students an oversized check made out to the school for $1,825.40. The money was donated by Target in Shakopee through the store's REDcard program. Customers who use a Target REDcard can choose a school for the store to donate to. Target will then donate up to 1 percent of all purchases made on those cards to the school of choice, and present a check to the schools every six months.
