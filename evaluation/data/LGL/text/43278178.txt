Six Flags Over Texas starting beer sales to visitors. Patrons of Six Flags Over Texas can begin guzzling beer today. On Tuesday, the park cleared the last hurdle when the head of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ruled that an opponent of the beer sales at the park would not get another hearing. Beer will be sold at six locations, and customers will only be allowed to drink in those restaurants or on their patios. Visitors caught drinking beer in an unauthorized area will be kicked out of the park, Six Flag officials have said. Opponents of the beer sales say it should not sold in a place that is heavily focused on and attended by youths.
