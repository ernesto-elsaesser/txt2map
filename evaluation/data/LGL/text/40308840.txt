Fumo, free on bail, will be sentenced July 13. Former State Sen. Vincent J. Fumo is to be sentenced at 10 a.m. July 13, according to an order from U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter filed yesterday. Fumo is free on $2 million bail, secured by his mansion and other real estate, after a jury convicted him Monday on 137 counts of conspiracy, fraud, tax offenses, and obstruction of justice. He faces a long prison term. Prosecutors are demanding that Fumo, a Democrat, pay the federal government $4,034,106.34 in forfeiture. They pegged the loss to the Senate at $2.4 million. They said a South Philadelphia nonprofit, Citizens' Alliance for Better Neighborhoods, had lost $1.5 million. Fumo, they said, also should pay $115,000 to cover the cost of illegal free yacht trips he took courtesy of the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia.
