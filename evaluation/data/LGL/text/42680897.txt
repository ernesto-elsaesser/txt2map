London can get to work . White believes the budgets may lay the foundation for establishing London as a "transportation gateway" which would see air cargo from Europe shipped across North America after landing in London after Canada and Europe recently agreed to an open skies agreement, a kind of free-trade deal for air cargo. "We have a natural asset here -- we have to turn it into something," White said of London's central geographic location, close to two U.S. states and Toronto. "It would give as another good area (to market the city). We have the university, life sciences, technology, logistics and manufacturing and we see this is a good match."
