Beers, sofas, TVs found in St. Marys River. St. Marys — The 130-mile St. Marys River is among the nation’s cleanest waterways, but not everyone cares. Although most people appreciate the St. Marys for its serenity and unspoiled beauty, beer drinkers have found another use for the river — as a dumping ground for their empties. Dean Woehrle, co-chairman of the St. Marys River Management Committee, estimates about 60 percent of the trash picked up each year during the St. Marys River Celebration is discarded beer bottles. Considering volunteers have pulled more than 500,000 pounds of trash from the river and its tributaries since the first cleanup in 1997, that’s a lot of empties. Woehrle believes the ratio of empties to other trash will remain the same when as many as 850 volunteers from Camden and Charlton counties in Georgia and Nassau and Baker counties in Florida participate in today’s cleanup. Of course, beer bottles aren’t the only trash pulled from the river each year. Past cleanups have turned up items such as couches, air conditioners, bowling balls, vehicle parts and refrigerators, stoves and other large appliances. Charlton County manager Steve Nance said he doesn’t understand why people dump household furnishings in the river, because the county picks up those items at no extra charge on trash collection days.
