Rescue squad seeks funds. Within the next week, all residents of Paris and Henry County will be receiving a letter from the Paris-Henry County Rescue Squad. This is the Rescue Squadâ€™s annual mail-out fundraiser in which the squad asks for a tax-deductible donation to help with daily operating expenses, enable the squad to purchase needed equipment, perform routine maintenance and efficiently conduct needed rescue operations in Henry County during the next year. The Rescue Squad is a volunteer organization with members trained in several different areas of emergency services, such as First Responders, EMTs, paramedics, emergency vehicle rescue, land and water search, and rescue divers.
