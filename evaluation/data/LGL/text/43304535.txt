Dumpster dive doesn't help fleeing suspect. On Thursday, March 26, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Titus County Sheriff's Office (TCSO) Deputy David Robinson and his canine partner, Browning, were on patrol and attempted to stop a vehicle on Edwards Street in Mount Pleasant for a traffic violation. The vehicle fled with Robinson's patrol unit in pursuit and Mount Pleasant Police Department (MPPD) patrol units on the way to assist Robinson. After turning onto West 16th Street, the vehicle's driver, Thomas Wayne Hellinghausen, 22, of Winfield, soon exited the moving vehicle and fled on foot. Deputies and officers from both departments converged on the scene and searched the area for Hellinghausen. As the search continued, MPPD officers located Hellinghausen in a nearby trash dumpster. As the deputies and officers spoke with the suspect, it was determined that Hellinghausen had ingested an unknown amount of methamphetamine before he bailed out of his vehicle. Hellinghausen was then transported to Titus Regional Medical Center to be treated. Hellinghausen was booked into the Titus County Jail where he was charged with a state jail felony charge of evading detention with a vehicle; a second state jail felony charge of possession of a controlled substance, penalty group one, under one gram; and a third degree felony charge of tampering with physical evidence.
