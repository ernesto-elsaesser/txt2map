Headington: Mum jailed for fake passport. A FAILED asylum seeker was jailed for 11 months yesterday after using a fake passport to work as a carer. Pauline Munene, 49, used a fake Kenyan passport to gain work with Chrysalis Community Care, formerly known as Blue Arrow, while living in Gladstone Road, Headington, Oxford. She was caught after a raid on her home last November. Oxford Crown Court heard Munene arrived in the UK from Nairobi in 2002 but her asylum application was rejected two years later. Munene admitted two charges of deception, two of possessing false identity documents with intent and one of fraud. Stephen Parker, defending, said Munene had been funding her 15-year-old daughter’s education back in Kenya. Judge Julian Hall said: “You have played fast and loose with the immigration rules in this country but simultaneously you have been a useful person to have here, doing work that a lot of people would not do. “But rules are rules and I have to punish you for breaking them.”
