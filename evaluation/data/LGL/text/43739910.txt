West Chester woman named Miss Butler County. HAMILTON â€” To the sounds of Kelly Clarkson's "A Moment Like This," Rebekah Zoz of West Chester Twp. walked away the crown at the Miss Greater Butler County Pageant Sunday night, March 29. Winning the Miss Teen title was Veronica Wende, 16, of Lima, and 9-year-old Au'Lauren Million of Middletown took the Little Miss title. All three winners were amazed at their success, and it hadn't quite sunk in Sunday night at the Heaven Sent Wedding Chapel. "I pretty much can't think about this yet," said Zoz, a 20-year-old University of Cincinnati student. Zoz will receive a $500 college scholarship and the chance to compete for the Miss Ohio title in Mansfield this June. The Mansfield winner may then compete for the Miss America title. "It's really great. I'm just thankful I won," said Million. She also won the People's Choice Award by popular vote from the audience. The contestants had to impress a panel of judges based on their skill at answering questions, modeling swimsuits and evening wear, and their performing talent. The first runner-ups were Hannah Smalls of Oxford in the Little Miss category, Kaitlin Craig of Elida in the Teen category and Devon Stansbury of Rockford in the Miss category. The program is open to contestants that live, work or attend school in Butler, Clark, Hamilton, Madison, Montgomery, Preble or Warren counties.
