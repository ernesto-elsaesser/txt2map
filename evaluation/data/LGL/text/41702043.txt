City council's goal planning under way. Does the City of Norfolk need a brand - a moniker of sorts that sums up its core? The city council Monday heard from representatives of a Denison, Iowa-based firm called bluespace creative that does branding for companies across the country. "A brand, in a nutshell, is perception,' said Scott Winey, creative director. Councilman Karl Reeder said a lot of work has been done and money spent on the effort under way to write a plan to develop the North Fork River corridor through downtown Norfolk. He asked what the Iowa company would do. Winey said the work includes interviewing community leaders, drafting an assessment and recommendations, a brand standards guide, visitors guide and logos and work on the city's Web site. The council is taking the idea under consideration.
