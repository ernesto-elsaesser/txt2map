Peabody closing eastern Illinois coal mine. RIDGE FARM, Ill. (AP) — Pebody Energy says it is closing an eastern Illinois coal mine because geological conditions prevent its expansion. Peabody says the roughly 160 employees of the Vermilion Grove mine near Ridge Farm will be offered transfers to the company’s 13 other mines across the Midwest. Employees were told Thursday. Company spokeswoman Megan Gallagher says the coal that can be safely reached in the mine is gone. She says further expansion isn’t practical or safe because of local geology. The mine opened in 2002. St. Louis-based Peabody Energy plans for workers to spend the next two months shutting the mine down. Ridge Farm is about 45 miles southeast of Champaign near the Indiana, Ill., border.
