County gets $36k for ‘05 bridge collapse. Henry County stands to receive about $36,000 in damages for the destruction of Bridge 136 over Big Creek, which collapsed in 2005 while a semi was attempting to cross it. The case went to a jury last week, with Trans Am Trucking Company, which operated the semi, seeking to pay no damages at all. Announcing the result at the county supervisors’ meeting this morning, County Engineer Bill Belzer said the final award would be about $35,900, plus an unknown amount of interest. It was a considerably smaller amount than the county had hoped for. “I didn’t think we’d get less than $50,000,” Belzer said, “considering the fact that Washington County had a smaller bridge that they got more money for.”
