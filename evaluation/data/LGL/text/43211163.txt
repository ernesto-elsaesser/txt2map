Prosecution rests in Ohio bathtub drowning trial . LEBANON (AP) â€” A forensic pathologist testifying in the trial of an Ohio man accused of drowning his wife in a bathtub says a bruise indicates someone grabbed the woman by her neck. Dr. Charles Jeffrey Lee testified Friday before the prosecution rested its case in the trial of 28-year-old Ryan Widmer. Widmer has pleaded not guilty to an aggravated murder charge in the August death of 24-year-old Sarah Widmer at their home in Warren County's Hamilton Township. Lee says Sarah Widmer could have drowned with her head pushed under water in a sink, bathtub or toilet. Defense attorney Charlie Rittgers said there were no other injuries or signs to suggest a struggle. The trial resumes Monday as the defense presents its case.
