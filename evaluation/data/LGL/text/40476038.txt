Coral Gables man charged with possessing child porn. A Coral Gables man was arrested on child pornography charges after he dropped his computer off for repairs, police said. A worker at the shop found pictures of naked children engaged in sex acts on Keith Martello's computer. Miami-Dade police's Internet Crimes Against Children unit got a search warrant for the computer and found lewd pictures of young girls, likely between the ages of 5 and 12, police said. Martello, 64, a retired Naval officer, was arrested Thursday for possession of child pornography.
