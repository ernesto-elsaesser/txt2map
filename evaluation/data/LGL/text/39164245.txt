University of Cincinnati to name interim president. CINCINNATI Â— The school's trustees are expected to name an interim president for the University of Cincinnati and hire a search firm to help find a full-time president. The officials are meeting Tuesday to discuss how to replace President Nancy Zimpher, who is leaving to become chancellor of the State University of New York on June 1. University of Cincinnati senior vice president Monica Rimai will be recommended to take over temporarily. But the 47-year-old will not be a candidate to permanently Zimpher. Zimpher has been president of the university since 2003. Rimai followed her to Cincinnati from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
