City Hall Digest . London city council will hire outside experts to defend itself and its rejection of a proposed medical clinic and pharmacy in north London. Developers who wanted to build the project on Richmond Street along the Uplands have appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board. City staff supported the development as did a minority on council, who pointed to new jobs, doctors, tax assessment and construction but they were out-voted by council members who said the development would betray the nearby community and a neighbourhood plan that placed retail across busy Richmond Street, London city council rejected creating a formal policy to seek partnerships with “sister cities” around the world. Advocates argues the relationship would put London in a better position to benefit from the global economy. But those opposing that step argued it would create unnecessary costs and bureaucracy and would place the city in a position of not being able to meet its obligations  the city has done little to sustain a previous “sister city” relationship with Quebec City and Nanjing, China. The issue of sister cities surfaced last year when Controller Gord Hume asked for $1,200 to visit Nanjing while on a personal trip to Beijing. Facing a backlash from some council members, Hume withdrew his request. Londoner will get a chance in May to weigh in on the future of the cit’s board of control. A public participation meeting will be held at 4 p.m. May 14 at Centennial Hall. Council has already recommended scrapping the board and dividing its functions after the 2010 civic election between two new committees of ward councillors.
