Man accused of possessing child porn. Terry Lee Jolly, 60, Lebanon, was arrested Thursday on a charge of possession child pornography. Jolly, who has no prior arrest record in Boone County, was taken into custody by Lebanon Police after a 5 p.m. Thursday traffic stop, LPD Lt. Brent Wheat said in a press release. He was formally arrested later Thursday after an interview with LPD detectives, Wheat said. Child pornography is a class D felony, which carries a sentence of up to three years in prison. Jolly, who gave addresses in the 700 block of East Washington Street and the 400 block of Elm Street, was held on $505 bond in the Boone County Jail. Lebanon Police and the Boone County Sheriff’s Office began an investigation after a Boone County 911 dispatcher said Jolly might have illegal images on a computer. Detectives from both agencies worked on the investigation, LPD Chief Tom Garoffolo said. Police confiscated “a large amount of computer equipment and other items” at three locations, Wheat said.
