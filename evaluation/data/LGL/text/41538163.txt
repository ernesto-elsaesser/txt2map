Kansas storm overturns big rigs . SALINA, Kan. Strong winds toppled 13 vehicles in central Kansas as a storm system moved into the state Monday. Lt. Mike Murphy of the Kansas Highway Patrol said the vehicles overturned in a stretch from Ellsworth to Riley counties. Several people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and several others refused treatment. Most of the vehicles were tractor-trailers and most overturned on Interstate 70. Murphy said in his more than two decades in law enforcement, “I have never seen this many semis blow over.” Wind gusts of more than 60 mph were recorded in Salina, while winds reached speeds of more than 90 mph at a prairie research site about five miles south of Manhattan.
