Rolling Meadows man stops burglary suspect with his car. A Rolling Meadows resident used his car to stop one of three men he saw putting his 100-pound safe into the trunk of their car, which was parked in his driveway when he arrived home, authorities said Saturday. The one man who got caught was being held on $10,000 bond Saturday on a charge of residential burglary after a bond hearing in Rolling Meadows. The suspect, Marcin Przydacz, 23, of the 3200 block of North Monticello in Chicago, was arrested at the scene, after the homeowner in the 2400 block of Jay Lane used his own car to block the vehicle in his driveway, authorities said.
