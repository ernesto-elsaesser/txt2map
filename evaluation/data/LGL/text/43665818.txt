LST-325 to travel to Jeffersonville in August. JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (AP) Â— A World War II troop landing ship typically docked in Evansville will travel to Jeffersonville in August. The LST-325 will spend more than a week at the city's riverfront from Aug. 21-30. The visit coincides with the American Legion's national convention in nearby Louisville, Ky. The LST-325 attracted thousands of visitors to Jeffersonville during a four-day visit in 2003. Mayor Tom Galligan says he expects this year's crowd to fill downtown. The ship was built in 1942 to hold 300 soldiers and 20 Sherman tanks. It landed on the beaches of Normandy during the D-Day invasion of Europe and made other trips ferrying troops and equipment to soldiers pushing to break the German stronghold on western Europe.
