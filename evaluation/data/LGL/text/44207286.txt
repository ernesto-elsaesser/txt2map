Preble voters can apply for absentee ballots. Voters may request an absentee ballot by mail. The request must include your name, home address, the mailing address to which the ballot is to be mailed (if different than home address), date of birth, driver's license number or last four digits of your Social Security number and your signature. If any of this information is missing, you will not receive the absentee ballot.
