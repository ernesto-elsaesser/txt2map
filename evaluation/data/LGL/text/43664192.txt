Manhattan High East student battles cancer. Standing about 6 feet tall with big brown eyes and a firm handshake, Artis Garvin-Cobb looks like your average "How did he ever grow up so fast?" 15-year-old. He has the personality to match, politely answering questions about football and his career aspirations, occasionally multitasking by teasing his older sister, Shay, or entertaining his nephew. He is sporting a black beanie, sure, but that could be written off as a fashion statement. And it is pretty cold outside.
