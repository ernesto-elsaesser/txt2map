Lebanon schedules spring clean-up. Residents again have a chance to clean up yards, nooks, under kitchen sinks and medicine cabinets. Days have been designated to discard leaves, limbs and other yard debris; to dispose of unneeded over-the-counter and prescription medicines and to set out trash too bulky to be left at curbside on a regular trash collection day. Yard cleanup days are April 6-9 and April 13-17, Lebanon Street Superintendent Larry Lee said. “This is not,” Lee said, “an invitation for somebody to cut down a tree.” Leaves should be raked to curbside and separated from tree limbs, he said. A “household haz-mat” disposal day sponsored by the Boone County Solid Waste District Management Board will be 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. May 16, the board decided at a recent quarterly meeting. A haz-mat day will be scheduled this fall in Zionsville, Waste District Director Dave Lamm said. Lebanon’s semi-annual heavy trash disposal day is 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 24-25 at the street department, 1301 Lafayette Ave., Lebanon. Only city residents may participate, Lee said. Only household items will be accepted. That excludes railroad ties, fences, construction debris, tires, oil-based paint and hazardous materials. There’s no cost, Lee said. Ray’s Trash, which has the city’s trash collection contract, and Gabriel Metals, a Lebanon recycling company, will again help with the clean-up, Lee said. Ray’s will provide Dumpsters and containers for bulk metal, Lee said. Gabriel Metals will haul away appliances, including refrigerators, air conditioners and water heaters, at no cost. The only condition is that compressors be removed from refrigerators.
