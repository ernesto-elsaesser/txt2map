Whoops! Lancaster aqueduct springs a leak. A LANDMARK feature on the River Lune has been closed – after springing a leak. The 200-year-old Lune Aqueduct has been closed by British Waterways for inspection and repairs. Dams are being installed to allow water in the aqueduct to be lowered for inspection by engineers. A spokesman for British Waterways says: “The aqueduct is one of the iconic structures on the waterways. We are speaking to waterways businesses that depend on the canal and, while we’re currently in the winter low season, I am mindful of the importance of the canal to local tourism should the aqueduct require a longer period of closure.” Built by canal engineer John Rennie between 1794 and 1797, the Grade I listed aqueduct – which carries the canal over the River Lune – is reputedly the finest aqueduct in North West England.
