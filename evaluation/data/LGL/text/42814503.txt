Lipscomb student from Paris devotes spring break to mission work. A Lipscomb University student from Paris didn’t spend her spring break lounging on the beach or sleeping late. Kelsey Dunkerson, Lipscomb biology major and daughter of Mike and Betty Dunkerson of Paris, is one of 300 Lipscomb students who traveled to 23 locations around the globe to carry out mission work during spring break last week. Dunkerson traveled to Chicacao, Guatemala. The team mi nistered to the Quiche Indians on the coast and hosted daily medical clinics in rural villages. Annual spring break mission trips, largely coordinated and carried out by students, are one of the various projects that earned Lipscomb University in Nashville a spot on the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll With Distinction in 2009, a group of just 83 universities around the nation who have met the criteria for this national honor. Mission teams do everything from working with a Boys and Girls Club and conducting a vacation Bible school, to manual labor projects for Habitat for Humanity and providing food and medical supplies, all the while outreaching and evangelizing. This year’s participants traveled to 12 countries, including Honduras, El Salvador, Canada and Guatemala — and five states within the United States. Twelve more missions trips are in the works for summer, involving more than 500 students in benevolent mission work in the 2008-09 school year.
