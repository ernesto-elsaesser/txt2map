Guilty plea in Indianapolis, Evansville killings. At the time Brown and two other men were indicted in 2006, prosecutors said that during an 18-day period Brown and two other men committed a series of robberies and attempted robberies of drug dealers and gambling houses in Indianapolis and Evansville that resulted in the deaths of four people and the wounding of eight others. The three men were arrested in Indianapolis on Dec. 31, 2005, three days after authorities said Brown and Jordan shot accomplice Vanessa Hankins, 26, of Indianapolis, on a sidewalk on the near east side of the city. Authorities say the men killed Hankins to keep her from talking with police.
