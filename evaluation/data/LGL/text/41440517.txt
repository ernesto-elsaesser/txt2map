Charlotte woman rescued after jumping into Grand River. Barb Modrack bmodrack@gannett.com March 23, 2009 From LSJ.com She was pulled from the bank of an island by a bystander, and airlifted to Sparrow Hospital, but did not appear to suffer life threatening injuries, said Grand Ledge Police Chief Martin Underhill. “She banged herself up real good,” Underhill said, but she was conscious and talking to rescuers after the jump. He estimated the water temperature was 40 degrees. Once in the river the woman floated from the bridge to an island, where she was pulled from the water by a bystander, Underhill said. “She was lying on the ground when we got to her,” said Casey Godlewski, chief of Grand Ledge Emergency Services. Because she had suffered a fall of more than 20 feet, Godlewski said, the decision was made to transport her by air to the hospital. “A young man got her out of the water,” Godlewski said.
