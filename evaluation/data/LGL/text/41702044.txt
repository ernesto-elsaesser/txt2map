Pack, troop members to 'scout for food'. Twenty-three Boy Scout and Cub Scout units from throughout Northeast Nebraska's Diamond Dick District will help fight hunger in "Scouting for Food 2009" scheduled for Saturday, April 4. Scouts first will be distributing door hangers this Saturday, March 28, in Norfolk and area communities. The door hangers will provide information about plans to pick up donated non-perishable food items starting at 8 a.m. on April 4. The food items collected will be given to local food pantries. Five Scout units from Norfolk - Pack 122, 124 and 131 and Troop 122 and 124 - will collect items for the Salvation Army, Improved Living Norfolk food bank and the Trinity Episcopal Church food pantry.
