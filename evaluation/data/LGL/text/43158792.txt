Is East Sheen shop luckiest in borough? . An East Sheen shop could be the luckiest business in the borough after one customer walked out with a jackpot-winning lottery ticket. But the winner, believed to be a newly-made millionaire after winning a minimum of £2.5m, will remain a mystery, after requesting to remain nameless with National Lottery operator Camelot. Jayshree Patel, who runs Moulton News, where the winning ticket was bought, said: “We don’t know who it is. They are anonymous, they don’t want the publicity. “We got a call from the lottery people saying we had a winner of at least £2.5m.” The Upper Richmond Road West shop owner has proudly put up a poster notifying customers a winning ticket was bought in her store. Mrs Patel added: “The customers have said ‘oh that’s good, this is a lucky shop.’ They are spreading it around. It is quite rare, especially around here.”
