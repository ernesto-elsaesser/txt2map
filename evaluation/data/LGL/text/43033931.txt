Phila. officer charged with drug dealing. The drug dealer, however, was the fabrication of an undercover officer, and the target of the sting was Weems, a 5 1/2-year veteran who "dishonored the badge," Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross said at a news conference yesterday at Police Headquarters. Ross was joined by federal authorities who conducted the months-long investigation of Weems. The arrest comes at a disturbing time in the department. A narcotics officer remains under investigation into allegations that he used bogus information to obtain search warrants. Another 18th District officer is on trial in federal court on charges of stealing drugs and money from dealers.
