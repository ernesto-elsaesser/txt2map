The men  49-year-old Christopher Marshall, 59-year-old Jerry Sargent and 31-year-old Bobby Cockerell  were captured Thursday evening in Alliance and taken to the county jail. They were transferred the next day to the Dawson County Jail in Lexington, about 186 miles southeast of Alliance. A woman who answered the phone at the jail Monday said the men were still there. The men escaped from the Branchville Correctional Facility on March 20.
