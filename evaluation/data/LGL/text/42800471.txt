State's action may cost Richmond new business, new jobs. By Bill Engle Staff Writer March 27, 2009 Luminous Electronics Recycling, a Denver-based company, was near announcing plans to open a new facility in Richmond, promising a $1.5 million initial investment in an existing building with hopes of hiring 50 to 70 workers within three years. “We’ve actually identified a facility and negotiated a lease,” Luminous company president Steve Fuelberth said Friday from Denver headquarters. “But part of our plan was to be able to access what the state of Indiana had to offer. “Once the program was dropped it caused us to step back and re-evaluate the exact location of that facility,” he said. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management decided to stop funding the grant and loan program in January, saying that cash-strapped local governments and businesses might not be able to provide matching dollars. Valerie Shaffer, manager of business attraction for the Economic Development Corporation of Wayne County, said she is still working with company officials to bring them here but admitted “they were discouraged when they heard the grant program had been frozen.” Fuelberth agreed the deal is not dead but added that he will investigate incentives offered by surrounding states.
