Woman wasn't kidnapped, now is charged in robbery. A Harlem woman initially identified as a kidnapping victim is now in jail, accused of participating in an armed robbery. Shashawna Diane Odell, 27, of the 500 block of Lou Lane, was charged with robbery, tampering with evidence and hindering the apprehension/punishent of a criminal. She was held without bond Monday in the Columbia County Detention Center, according to jail records. Police said her boyfriend Christopher Grier, of the 700 block of Knox Road in Harlem, is suspected in the armed robbery Friday of two individuals in their Grovetown home. At first, police believed Mr. Grier committed the robbery, then kidnapped Ms. Odell and their 7-month-old son and made her drive him to Monroeville, Ala. An Amber Alert was issued for Ms. Odell and her son after she called her mother in Washington, D.C. The mother called police, saying her daughter had been kidnapped, said Investigator Scott Wheatley of the Grovetown Department of Public Safety. Police found Ms. Odell and stopped her in Newton County, Ga. After they confirmed that she and the baby were safe, Ms. Odell drove back to Harlem on Sunday. Grovetown police then questioned Ms. Odell, who admitted that she willingly drove Mr. Grier to Alabama. She also told police that she drove the getaway car for Mr. Grier as he conducted the robbery and disposed of the gun he used, Investigator Wheatley said. The gun was recovered on Kings Way in Harlem. Mr. Grier is wanted for the robbery, but the kidnapping warrants have been dropped, Columbia County sheriff's Capt. Steve Morris said.
