Culver pushing new rules on dependant adult abuse. Less than a month after creating a task force to address dependent adult abuse, Gov. Chet Culver is urging the legislature to begin making changes to strengthen and improve Iowa law. The governor received a series of initial legislative recommendations from the task force. Culver spoke about this issue today at a meeting of the Dependent Care Task Force, where he was joined by Government Oversight Committee co-chairs Sen. Rich Olive, D-Story City and Rep. Vicki Lensing, D-Iowa City. “Over the past 30 years, bureaucracy at every level of government failed these men,” said Culver. “We have a chance to rectify past mistakes by making the changes to our laws necessary to protect our most vulnerable Iowans and punish those who abuse them.” The task force was formed following allegations about the treatment and living conditions of men at Henry’s Turkey Service, a Texas-based company operating a bunkhouse in Atalissa.
