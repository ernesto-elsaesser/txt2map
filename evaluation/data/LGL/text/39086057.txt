Lebanon establishes embassy in Syria. A Lebanese parliamentarian praised the opening of his county's first-ever embassy in Syria on Monday but warned that much remained to be done to improve bilateral relations between the two countries. In addition, he said a number of agreements that have been previously signed between Lebanon and Syria that should be revised or even annulled as the two countries embark on a new era of diplomatic relations, particularly the Lebanon-Syria Treaty of Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination Agreement. That 1991 agreement effectively legalized the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon and suggested the two countries closely coordinate their foreign policies to reflect "the shared destiny and interests of the two countries." Syria first sent its troops into Lebanon in the 1970s while the country was engulfed in civil war.
