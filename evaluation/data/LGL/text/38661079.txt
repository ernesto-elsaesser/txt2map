Iraqi national found dead in Maameltein . In February last year, the Lebanese government said it would give all foreigners, including Iraqi refugees, who stayed in the country after their visas expired, a three-month period during which they could legalize their status. But it remains unclear exactly how many Iraqis regulated their status during that time. BEIRUT: The body of an Iraqi national was discovered on Saturday, a police report said. Mohammad Abed al-Wahab, born in 1952, was found dead in the town of Maameltein, Keserwan. The cause of death has not yet been confirmed, but a forensics team is investigating.
