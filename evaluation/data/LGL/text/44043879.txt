Family takes bait, opens fishing shop. By KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK  Wess Henry, who lost his home to foreclosure last year, was fishing for a way to change his luck. He hopes his fortunes change after he opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop on Friday the 13th of March. Henry and his son, Matt, are co-owners of the business at 197 N. Cedar St.Henry purchased the inventory of Newark Live Bait, which closed its Western Avenue business in January. He then found the rent at the Cedar Street location was affordable. The unlikely chain of events started when Matt Henry started planning for a fishing trip a few months ago. “I called down there (to Newark Live Bait) to see what they wanted for bait and she said, I’ll give you what I got because I’m going out of business,’” Matt Henry said. “And, she gave me a price for everything in the store. It was an offer we couldn’t refuse.” The Henrys had talked about opening a bait shop, but the did not know that Newark Live Bait was going out of business until his son stumbled onto the news. “I’d say it was fisherman’s luck,” Wess Henry said. “Everything seemed to fall into place, If (Matt) hadn’t decided to go fishing, it probably wouldn’t be reality. I still can’t believe I’m here.” Wess Henry, 47, a 14-year employee of Tectum Inc., had just enough savings to start the business without a loan, which he said he probably could not have secured anyway. The Henrys said they have a good chance of developing a successful business once people discover them and their location because there is not much competition. “The fishermen are spreading the word amongst themselves,” Wess Henry said. “Everyone is so glad we’re here because there’s nowhere else to get bait. “I’m just trying to listen to what customers want. If people want something, I’ll try to get it in within a week from the bait dealer.” Wess Henry does have some retail experience. His parents had operated what Wess said was the largest bicycle shop in Licking County in the 1980s, Mound City Bicycle Shop on Idlewilde Avenue. The shop will continue the tradition from Newark Live Bait of providing fishing contests and offering a raffle and door prizes. Wess Henry also dabbles in woodworking and sells some of his work at the shop. The recession could actually work in the Henrys’ favor in a couple ways, Matt said. “It may even spike when the economy is down because, when people are laid off, there is nothing else to do, and they may as well go fishing,” he said. “I’d say it’s about the cheapest hobby left.” Although fishermen can spend large amounts of money for equipment and boats, the Henrys said they also can get started with a license and minimal equipment for about $50. Another potential benefit from the poor economy is stimulus money offered from the government. Matt Henry applied for $100,000 to hire employees, purchase more inventory and even open up a second store. “I said, just for the heck of it, apply for it,” Wess said he told his son. Matt Henry, 24, said he’s counting on the business lasting well into the future. “I hope it’s here for the next 40 years,” Matt Henry said. “Essentially, this is what I want to make my life’s work.” Matt Henry, left, and his father, Wess Henry, opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop at 197 N.
