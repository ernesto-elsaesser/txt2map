Film Festival director visits Columbia State. The Columbia State Lyceum Committee and Student Services presented a lecture by Nashville Film Festival Director, Brian Owens March 4. Owens gave students a sneak preview of short films, which will debut next month when the Nashville Film Festival Season opens, and answered students’ questions about opportunities in the film industry. Owens encouraged students that, despite the current economic climate, he believes the area of film and entertainment will continue to grow and there will be many new jobs generated by festivals. “As the distribution of cinema changes, film festivals are more important than ever for shedding light on works of unique and challenging cinema that most filmgoers don’t get to see at the cineplex,” Owens said. “There is a growing infrastructure being created to help young filmmakers and open new markets among people who like to make and watch movies on television, on the computer and in theaters.” Nashville Film Festival Director Brian Owens, right, speaks with Stewart Lenig, head of the Columbia State Community College drama department, and CSCC student Trishae Dotson following his presentation at the college earlier this month.
