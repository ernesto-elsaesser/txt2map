Chiefland man, 19, stabbed in the back. A 19-year-old who tried to avoid a fight with another 19-year-old wound up being stabbed in the back four times. The stabbing victim was taken to the hospital while the man accused of knifing him went to jail. The incident happened at about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the Hardeetown area of Chiefland. Police Chief Robert Douglas said Stephen Davis, of Chiefland, had been arguing with Michael Durr, of Trenton. “Witnesses told our officers that Davis tried to walk away, but Durr continued taunting him, and it got physical when Durr hit him (Davis) with a closed fist,” Douglas said. Witnesses said Durr pulled out a knife with a black handle and a four- to five-inch-long blade that he used to stab Davis four times. Davis was taken to a Gainesville hospital for treatment of a punctured lung and other injuries. Durr fled from the scene and reportedly headed to a house outside Chiefland where he had been living with his girlfriend and their baby, parking the BMW he had been driving in the garage. Levy County sheriff's Deputy Mark Morgan was dispatched to the home Saturday morning because a fire had been reported there. Sheriff’s spokesman Capt. Evan Sullivan said the State Fire Marshal's Office sent investigators to the scene because local firefighters believed the fire was suspicious. Durr was arrested a short time later and charged with aggravated battery.
