TfL launch £4.2m scheme to encourage bike use and reduce car journeys. A £4.2m scheme designed to reduce cars on the roads and encourage people to embrace eco-friendly transport launched today. “Despite its leafy image, Richmond faces the same challenges in terms of congestion and air pollution as other parts of London." The three-year scheme aims to encourage greater use of sustainable travel options, such as walking, cycling or using public transport, as well as reducing traffic congestion and improving the environment. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: “Despite its leafy image, Richmond faces the same challenges in terms of congestion and air pollution as other parts of London. “This scheme will help make the borough an even greener, healthier place for people to live and work. “I can imagine nothing better than cycling through parts of Richmond, but this will mean that people across the borough will find it much easier to take to two wheels.” The money will be used to create 450 new cycle parking spaces - 200 were installed before the official launch - two new cycle routes, new cycling facilities and car club bays, cycle training sessions and improve signage and mapping for pedestrians in Richmond and Twickenham town centres. There will also be the introduction of ‘Walk on Wednesday’ to all primary schools in the borough and the development of travel plans, and the provision of more information on sustainable transport to residents, schools and businesses. TfL’s director for transport policy, Kulveer Ranger, added: “Underlying all of that, is TfL working with the borough to see how we can reduce our carbon footprint. “Eighty eight per cent of people who live in Richmond feel there is a problem with traffic, we know we cannot keep buying and using more and more cars.” “This is a major initiative to ask people - residents, businesses and schools - to use sustainable transport which is smarter, better for the environment.”
