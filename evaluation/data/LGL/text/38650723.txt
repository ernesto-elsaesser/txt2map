Pierce keeps clerk office. Democratic incumbent Linda Pierce has secured the office of Muscogee County clerk Clerk of Superior Court, beating Republican challenger Reba Rae by more than 26,000 votes. Pierce received 47,876 votes, or 69 percent of the vote. Rae received 21,049 votes, or 31 percent. "It's a very humbling thing to be elected again," Pierce said. "I'm very grateful to the voters and I promise I'll do the best job possible." Pierce, 56, has held the clerk position since 1989. Before taking office, Pierce spent time in the Air Force and as an attorney in private practice. Her first job was as a congressional aide. The Muscogee County Clerk of Superior Court is in charge of keeping the county's records  criminal, civil and real estate. The clerk also keeps records for the State and Juvenile courts. The clerk communicates with all parts of the court system and is often the first stop for many encountering the courts. The clerk's office is located on the second floor of the Columbus Government Center. Over the next few years, Pierce said she wants to continue delivering excellent customer service and preparing for the future  namely, through efforts to make her office completely paperless. Her office has worked toward moving real estate documents online and providing help via e-mail. Rae, 55, currently serves as a deputy clerk in the Harris County Clerk's office. She has been in a clerk's office for about 20 years in Muscogee and Harris counties.
